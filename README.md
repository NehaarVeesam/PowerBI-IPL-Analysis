Power BI is a business analytics service by Microsoft that provides interactive visualizations and business intelligence capabilities with an interface simple enough for end users to create their own reports and dashboards.

I've used two datasets:
1.ipl_ball_by_ball_2008_2022.csv
2.ipl_matches_2008_2022.csv

Using different available features on PowerBI , it is quite easy to analyse the data , give useful insights.
